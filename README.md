# Django Learning Path: Hello World App

Welcome to the **Django Learning Path** repository! This project marks the first step in my journey to learning Django. In this initial step, I've created a basic "Hello World" app that demonstrates how Django handles HTTP requests and returns responses.

## Overview

This repository focuses on the foundational aspects of Django development. My first project in this learning path is a simple Django application that responds with "Hello, World!" when the corresponding URL is visited. This app helps me understand how to set up a basic Django project, create views, and configure URL routing.

### Key Features:
- **Hello World Response**: A basic response in Django that returns a "Hello, World!" message when a user visits the designated URL.
- **Project Setup**: Basic configuration of a Django project, including the creation of necessary files like `urls.py`, `views.py`, and `settings.py`.

### What I Learned:
1. **Setting Up a Django Project**: Learned how to create and set up a Django project from scratch.
2. **Understanding Views**: Explored how views are created in Django to handle HTTP requests.
3. **URL Configuration**: Configured the URLs to map specific paths to corresponding views.
4. **HTTP Responses**: Gained insight into how Django returns an HTTP response to a client.

## Key Django Concepts Covered:

### 1. **Setting Up Views and URL Routing**:
   - A view is a Python function that receives a web request and returns a web response.
   - URL routing maps a URL to a specific view in Django, making it accessible in the web browser.

   Example of `views.py`:
   ```python
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   def hello_world(request):
       return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
